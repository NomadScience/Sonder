# Sonder

Sonder is an "augmented compass"  prototype for intuitive neighborhood/street discovery using a device's fusion sensor.

It uses React Native, but the compass code is completely decoupled from interface and can/should be broken out. The update loop is designed to be performant on a single thread.
